# Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Costs Through Geo-Spatial Analysis of Delivery Route Density

## Overview

This project analyzes geospatial data to optimize last-mile delivery routes and reduce costs.  The analysis leverages delivery density and traffic pattern data to identify inefficiencies in current routes. The goal is to recommend specific route adjustments that will reduce last-mile delivery costs by 15% within the next quarter.  The project performs data cleaning, density analysis, and visualization to support data-driven recommendations for route optimization.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Geopandas (or other relevant geospatial library)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required Python libraries listed above using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   *Note:*  You will need to provide the appropriate input data files as specified within the `main.py` script.  These files should be pre-processed and in a format compatible with the libraries used (e.g., CSV, GeoJSON).


## Example Output

The script will print key findings of the analysis to the console, including summary statistics on delivery density, identified areas of inefficiency, and estimated cost savings from proposed route adjustments.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., heatmaps of delivery density, optimized route maps) in the `output` directory.  These visualizations will help illustrate the analysis and the impact of proposed route changes.  Example output files might include:

* `density_heatmap.png`: A heatmap visualizing delivery density across the geographical area.
* `optimized_routes.png`: A map visualizing the current and optimized delivery routes.
* `cost_savings_report.txt`: A text file summarizing the estimated cost savings.

(The exact output files and their names might vary depending on the final implementation.)
